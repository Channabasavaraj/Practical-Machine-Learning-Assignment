Activity Analysis and their Patterns in their behavior:

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.
 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, we will use data recorded from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
 
More information is available from the website http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
 
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise. This is the classe variable of the training set, which classifies the correct and incorrect outcomes into A, B, C, D, and E categories. This report describes how the model for the project was built, its cross validation, expected out of sample error calculation, and the choices made. It was used successfully to accurately predict all 20 different test cases on the Coursera website.
